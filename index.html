                    <h2>About Tadas </h2>
                    <p>My son Tadas was born only 28 weeks old. His weight was just 1200g (2,6lb). 
                        Tadas' condition was very serious. From the first minutes of his life he had 
                        to fight for survival. He was incubated for applying an artificial lung 
                        ventilation, because he could not breathe himself. After a few days his 
                        condition got worse. He was diagnosed with brain bruising, what resulted 
                        into hydrocephalus (the brain water).This damaged his brain. He was diagnosed 
                        with children's cerebral palsy. Doctors did not give us too much hope, 
                        they had only two opinions: my son's death or permanent disability.<br>
                        Thank God, their opinions did not materialize. With the big help of 
                        professionals my son can enjoy walking, more less take care of his own life.<br>
                        That my sonâ€™s Tadas situation be stable, it requires constant work 
                        (therapeutic exercise, occupational health, acupuncture, various massages, 
                        swimming, horse and dolphin therapy, etc.). Miscellaneous equipment and 
                        operations are necessary. However, it costs a lot of money.<br>
                        Of course, all this can be abandoned. But I do not want to stop 
                        halfway as so much has been achieved. <br>
                        With this economic situation, I have not enough money to treat my son. 
                        Your support is needed for the treatment only. </p>
